# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Health Check Endpoint Mismatch
**Problem**: Railway was looking for `/api/health` but the controller only had `/health`
**Fix**: Added `/api/health` endpoint to HealthController

### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Application may fail to start due to database connection timeouts
**Fix**: Added connection pooling and timeout configurations

### 3. Missing Spring Boot Actuator
**Problem**: No proper health check infrastructure
**Fix**: Added `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency

## Changes Made

### 1. HealthController.java
- Added `/api/health` endpoint for Railway health checks
- Improved response structure for better monitoring

### 2. application-prod.properties
- Added HikariCP connection pool settings
- Added database validation and SSL configurations
- Added management endpoints for health monitoring
- Increased health check timeout to 300 seconds

### 3. pom.xml
- Added Spring Boot Actuator dependency

### 4. railway.json
- Increased health check timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Added JVM optimization flags (-Xmx512m, -Djava.awt.headless=true)
- Reduced restart retries to 5

### 5. StylerBackendApplication.java
- Added startup logging
- Added initialization confirmation
- Better error handling

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment health check issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway**:
   - Railway should automatically detect the changes
   - Monitor the deployment logs for the new health check behavior

3. **Verify Endpoints**:
   - `/api/health` - Main health check (used by Railway)
   - `/actuator/health` - Spring Boot Actuator health check
   - `/health` - Original health endpoint
   - `/` - Root endpoint with API information

## Expected Health Check Response

The `/api/health` endpoint should return:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "message": "Styler Backend API is healthy",
  "timestamp": 1696339200000,
  "service": "styler-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. Check Railway logs for database connection errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `PGUSER`
   - `PGPASSWORD`
   - `PORT`

3. Test locally with production profile:
   ```bash
   java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -Dserver.port=8080 -jar target/styler-backend-1.0.0.jar
   ```

## Performance Optimizations Applied

- **Memory**: Limited JVM heap to 512MB for Railway's resource limits
- **Connection Pool**: Maximum 5 connections to prevent database overload
- **Timeouts**: Reasonable connection and validation timeouts
- **SSL**: Proper SSL configuration for Railway PostgreSQL

The application should now start successfully and pass Railway's health checks.
